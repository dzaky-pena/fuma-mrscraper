The **Map Scraper** lets you input a single website URL and instantly retrieve **all URLs found on that domain**.  
This is the fastest way to understand a website’s structure, map out pages, or prepare for large-scale scraping tasks.


## When to Use the Map Scraper

Use the Map Scraper when you need to:

- Get all URLs from a website quickly

- Find hidden pages that are not linked from navigation but appear in the HTML

- Audit a website’s structure for SEO, content planning, or data coverage checks

- Collect links for further processing such as job postings, blog articles, or category pages



## Example Usage
1. Go to your **Dashboard** → click **Create Scraper** → select **Map**.   
2. Enter the **URL** (for example: `https://penateam.com`) you want to scrape.

3. Wait for the system to process the URL. The Map Scraper automatically extracts:
   - Internal links
   - Subpage URLs
   - Category links
   - Pagination links
4. Once completed, you’ll receive a clean, structured list of URLs in JSON format:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://penateam.com",
    "https://penateam.com/blog",
    "https://penateam.com/blog/Conten_Lifecycle_Management",
