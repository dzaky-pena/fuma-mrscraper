MrScraper’s **Bulk Scraping** feature allows you to extract data from multiple URLs in a single operation, saving you time and effort. You can upload a list of URLs and apply the same scraping configuration to all of them, making it easy to gather large datasets quickly.

<Callout title="Tip" type="success">
    This feature is perfect for users who need to scrape data from multiple pages with similar structures, such as product listings, articles, or profiles.
</Callout>

### Usage Example

To perform a bulk scrape, follow these steps:

1. Open a new or existing scraper in your MrScraper dashboard.  
2. Click **Bulk Scraping** button on the top section.
3. You can either upload an Excel file (.xlsx, .xls) containing the list of URLs or paste them directly into the provided text area (one URL per line).

    <Callout title="Excel Format">
        The file should have a column with header "url" or "URL". Each row should contain one URL.
    </Callout>

4. Once the URLs are added, click **Save** and **Run All** to initiate the process.

<Callout title="Note">
    Token will be consumed for each URL scraped in bulk, so ensure you have sufficient tokens in your account before initiating a bulk scrape.
</Callout>

## Check Results

You can monitor the progress of your bulk scraping job in the **Results** page. Once completed, you can view and download the scraped data for each URL individually.
