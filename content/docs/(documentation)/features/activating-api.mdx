MrScraper lets you run any scraper you’ve created directly through an API endpoint. This is useful when you want to automate scraping, integrate it into your application, or test requests in tools like Postman.




## How to Run a Scraper Through the API
1. Open your dashboard and select a scraper you’ve already created. If you don’t have one yet, create it first.
2. In the scraper window, click **Settings**.
3. Select **AI Scraper API Access** and slide to activate it.

4. After activation, copy the example API request shown on the page.
5. Paste the request into [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (or another API tool).
<Callout title="Note"> You can replace the URL with any URL you want to scrape. </Callout>

6. You can also run the scraper directly from [Rerun an AI Scraper endpoint](/docs/api/ScraperAiRerun).
