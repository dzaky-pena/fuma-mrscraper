## What Is Scheduling?

Scheduling allows you to automate the execution of your scrapers at predefined times or intervals. This ensures that your data is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

## When to Use Scheduling?

Scheduling is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- **Regular Data Updates:** If you need to keep your data fresh, such as daily price monitoring or weekly news aggregation.
- **Time-Sensitive Data:** For data that changes frequently, like stock prices or social media trends.
- **Resource Management:** To run scrapers during off-peak hours to optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

## Usage Example

Follow these steps to schedule your scraper:

1. Navigate to your **Scrapers page** by clicking the **triangle icon** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the scraper you want to schedule.
3. Click on the **Settings** button, and click **Schedule**.
4. In the **Schedule Scraper** menu, choose your scraper mode.
5. Choose your preferred scheduling time by choosing in the dropdown menu, you can choose between `Every Hour`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, or `Custom`.
6. If you select `Custom`, specify the exact interval and unit for your scraper to run. You can set it to run every X minutes, hours, or days.
7. Click **Save Schedule** to apply your settings.

### Result

Once scheduled, your scraper will automatically run at the specified intervals, and you can see its results in the **Results** page. You can modify or cancel the schedule at any time by returning to the **Schedule** settings of your scraper.
