## When to Use Manual Workflow

Use the Manual Scraper when you need to:

- Extract data from complex or dynamic websites that require specific interactions.  
- Have precise control over the scraping process and data extraction logic.
- Handle large-scale or repetitive scraping tasks with consistent structure.  
- Implement custom workflows that involve multiple steps, such as navigation, data extraction, and pagination.

## Step

You can add multiple steps to your scraper by clicking on the "Add Step" button. Each step allows you to define specific actions such as extract, click, delay, etc. Here are the available step types:

### Extract

The Extract step allows you to specify the data you want to scrape from the webpage. You can set `Extraction Name`, select `Extraction Type` to `Text` (ex: Hello World), `Inner HTML` (ex: \<span\>hello world\<\/span\>), `Outer HTML` (ex: \<h1 class="bold">\<span>hello world\<\/span>\<\/h1>), and `Attribute` (ex: "class": bold), and define CSS selectors to target specific elements.

### Click

The Click step allows you to simulate a click action on a specified element.

### Delay

The Delay step allows you to pause the scraper for a specified amount of time (in milliseconds) before proceeding to the next step.

### Input

The Input step allows you to enter text into input fields on the webpage.

### Scroll

The Scroll step allows you to scroll until the end, scroll until find a text scroll, or scroll to a specific element (or until the number of a specific element) on the webpage.

### Inject Javascript

The Inject Javascript step allows you to run custom JavaScript code on the webpage.

### Paginate

Set up pagination to navigate through multiple pages automatically.

| Pagination Type | Required Parameter |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Query pagination | Query Parameter (eg. "?page=2") |
| Directory pagination (eg. "/list/page/2") | - |
| Next page link | Next page selector |

## Usage Example

Follow these steps to create a Manual Scraper from your dashboard:

1. Click on 'New Scraper +' on scrapers page
2. Insert the link of the website you want to scrape
3. Select 'Manual Workflow' on top
4. Configure your scraper by adding steps

### Example 1: Click, Extract and Delay

Add a Click step to open the book category.

- Element to Click : `div.side_categories ul li ul li a`

Add an Extract step to scrape book titles from a webpage.

- Extraction Name: `Book Title`
- Extraction Type: `Text`
- Selector: `h3 a`

This will extract the text content of all elements with the class `h3 a`.

Add a Delay step to make it more natural.

- Duration (milliseconds): `2000`

Result :

```json
{
  "Book Title": [
    "A Light in the ...",
    "Tipping the Velvet",
    "Soumission",
    "Sharp Objects",
    "Sapiens: A Brief History ...",
    "The Requiem Red",
    "The Dirty Little Secrets ...",
    "The Coming Woman: A ...",
    "The Boys in the ...",
    "The Black Maria",
    "Starving Hearts (Triangular Trade ...",
    "Shakespeare's Sonnets",
    "Set Me Free",
    "Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little ...",
    "Rip it Up and ...",
    "Our Band Could Be ...",
    "Olio",
    "Mesaerion: The Best Science ...",
    "Libertarianism for Beginners",
    "It's Only the Himalayas"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Scroll, Input and Paginate

Add a Scroll step to scroll down the page and load more book listings.

- Scroll Type: `Scroll until find a text`
- Scroll Text: `Load More`

Add an Input step to enter a search query.

- Input Field Selector: `input[name="search"]`
- Text Input: `Fiction`

Add a Paginate step to navigate through multiple pages of book listings.

- Pagination Type: `Query pagination`
- Query Parameter: `?page=`

This will allow the scraper to navigate through pages by appending `?page=` followed by the page number to the URL.

Result :

```json
{
  "Book Title": [
    "A Light in the ...",
    "Tipping the Velvet",
    "The Requiem Red",
    "The Black Maria",
    "Set Me Free",
    "Olio"
  ]
}
```
