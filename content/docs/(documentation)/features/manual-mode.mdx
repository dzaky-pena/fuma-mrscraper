The **Manual Scraper** in MrScraper allows you to create custom scraping workflows by defining a series of steps to extract data from web pages. This mode is ideal for users who need full control over the scraping process and want to handle complex scenarios.

## When you Should Use Manual Scraper

Use the Manual Scraper when you need to:

- Extract data from complex or dynamic websites that require specific interactions.  
- Have precise control over the scraping process and data extraction logic.
- Handle large-scale or repetitive scraping tasks with consistent structure.  
- Implement custom workflows that involve multiple steps, such as navigation, data extraction, and pagination.

## Creating a Manual Scraper

Follow these steps to create a Manual Scraper from your dashboard:

1. Click on 'New Scraper +' on scrapers page
2. Insert the link of the website you want to scrape
3. Select 'Manual Workflow' on top
4. Configure your scraper by adding steps

You can add multiple steps to your scraper by clicking on the "Add Step" button. Each step allows you to define specific actions such as extract, click, delay, etc.

## Step Types

### Extract

The Extract step allows you to specify the data you want to scrape from the webpage. You can set `Extraction Name`, select `Extraction Type` to `Text` (ex: Hello World), `Inner HTML` (ex: \<span\>hello world\<\/span\>), `Outer HTML` (ex: \<h1 class="bold">\<span>hello world\<\/span>\<\/h1>), and `Attribute` (ex: "class": bold), and define CSS selectors to target specific elements.

### Click

The Click step allows you to simulate a click action on a specified element.

### Delay

The Delay step allows you to pause the scraper for a specified amount of time (in milliseconds) before proceeding to the next step.

### Input

The Input step allows you to enter text into input fields on the webpage.

### Scroll

The Scroll step allows you to scroll until the end, scroll until find a text scroll, or scroll to a specific element (or until the number of a specific element) on the webpage.

### Inject Javascript

The Inject Javascript step allows you to run custom JavaScript code on the webpage.

### Paginate

Set up pagination to navigate through multiple pages automatically.

| Pagination Type | Required Parameter |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Query pagination | Query Parameter (eg. "?page=2") |
| Directory pagination (eg. "/list/page/2") | - |
| Next page link | Next page selector |

## Usage Example

### Example 1: Extract

Add an Extract step to scrape book titles from a webpage.

- Extraction Name: `Book Title`
- Extraction Type: `Text`
- Selector: `h3 a`

This will extract the text content of all elements with the class `h3 a`.

Result :

```json
{
  "Book Title": [
    "A Light in the ...",
    "Tipping the Velvet",
    "Soumission",
    "Sharp Objects",
    "Sapiens: A Brief History ...",
    "The Requiem Red",
    "The Dirty Little Secrets ...",
    "The Coming Woman: A ...",
    "The Boys in the ...",
    "The Black Maria",
    "Starving Hearts (Triangular Trade ...",
    "Shakespeare's Sonnets",
    "Set Me Free",
    "Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little ...",
    "Rip it Up and ...",
    "Our Band Could Be ...",
    "Olio",
    "Mesaerion: The Best Science ...",
    "Libertarianism for Beginners",
    "It's Only the Himalayas"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Paginate

Add a Paginate step to navigate through multiple pages of book listings.

- Pagination Type: `Query pagination`
- Query Parameter: `?page=`

This will allow the scraper to navigate through pages by appending `?page=` followed by the page number to the URL.

Result :

```json
{
  "Book Title": [
    "A Light in the ...",
    "Tipping the Velvet",
    "Soumission",
    "Sharp Objects",
    "Sapiens: A Brief History ...",
