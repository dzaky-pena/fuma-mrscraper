## When to Use Manual Workflow

Use the Manual Scraper when you need to:

- Extract data from complex or dynamic websites that require specific interactions.  
- Have precise control over the scraping process and data extraction logic.
- Handle large-scale or repetitive scraping tasks with consistent structure.  
- Implement custom workflows that involve multiple steps, such as navigation, data extraction, and pagination.

## Manual Scraper Features

Below are the available step types you can add when building a manual scraper:

| Step Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Extract** | Scrape data from the webpage by setting an **Extraction Name**, choosing an **Extraction Type** (`Text`, `Inner HTML`, `Outer HTML`, or `Attribute`), and defining CSS selectors to target elements. |
| **Click** | Simulates a click action on a specified element. |
| **Delay** | Pauses the scraper for a set duration (in milliseconds) before moving to the next step. |
| **Input** | Enters text into input fields on the webpage. |
| **Scroll** | Scrolls to the end of the page, scrolls until a specific text is found, or scrolls to a specific element (or until a certain number of elements). |
| **Inject JavaScript** | Runs custom JavaScript code on the webpage. |
| **Paginate** | Automatically navigates through multiple pages. |

### Pagination Types

| Pagination Type | Required Parameter |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Query Pagination** | Query parameter (e.g., `?page=2`) |
| **Directory Pagination** | None (e.g., `/list/page/2`) |
| **Next Page Link** | Next page selector |

## Usage Example

Follow these steps to create a Manual workflow for existing scraper from your dashboard:

1. Click on 'Scraper' in the left sidebar.
2. Select the Scraper you want to configure.
3. Select 'Manual Workflow' on top.
4. Configure your scraper by adding steps.

### Example 1: Click, Extract and Delay

Add a Click step to open the book category.

- Element to Click : `div.side_categories ul li ul li a`

Add an Extract step to scrape book titles from a webpage.

- Extraction Name: `Book Title`
- Extraction Type: `Text`
- Selector: `h3 a`

This will extract the text content of all elements with the class `h3 a`.

Add a Delay step to make it more natural.

- Duration (milliseconds): `2000`

Result :

```json
{
  "Book Title": [
    "A Light in the ...",
    "Tipping the Velvet",
    "Soumission",
    "Sharp Objects",
    "Sapiens: A Brief History ...",
    "The Requiem Red",
    "The Dirty Little Secrets ...",
    "The Coming Woman: A ...",
    "The Boys in the ...",
    "The Black Maria",
    "Starving Hearts (Triangular Trade ...",
    "Shakespeare's Sonnets",
    "Set Me Free",
    "Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little ...",
    "Rip it Up and ...",
    "Our Band Could Be ...",
    "Olio",
    "Mesaerion: The Best Science ...",
    "Libertarianism for Beginners",
    "It's Only the Himalayas"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Scroll, Input and Paginate

Add a Scroll step to scroll down the page and load more book listings.

- Scroll Type: `Scroll until find a text`
- Scroll Text: `Load More`

Add an Input step to enter a search query.

- Input Field Selector: `input[name="search"]`
- Text Input: `Fiction`

Add a Paginate step to navigate through multiple pages of book listings.

- Pagination Type: `Query pagination`
- Query Parameter: `?page=`

This will allow the scraper to navigate through pages by appending `?page=` followed by the page number to the URL.

Result :

```json
{
  "Book Title": [
    "A Light in the ...",
    "Tipping the Velvet",
    "The Requiem Red",
    "The Black Maria",
    "Set Me Free",
    "Olio"
  ]
}
```
