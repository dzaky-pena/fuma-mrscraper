MrScraper’s **AI Scraper** lets you extract structured data from any web page by simply describing what you need — no coding or manual setup required.   You provide a **URL** and a **prompt**, and the AI automatically analyzes the page, extracts relevant data, and returns the result in a structured format like JSON or CSV.

<Callout title="Tip" type="success">
This feature is ideal for users and developers who want fast, flexible, and intelligent web scraping without writing rules or managing selectors.

## When to Use the AI Scraper

Use the AI Scraper when you want to:

- Quickly extract data from a website without building a scraper manually.  
- Collect small to medium-sized datasets with natural language instructions.  
- Automate repetitive data collection tasks where precision is less critical.  
- Prototype or test scraping ideas before committing to a full custom workflow.  

For large-scale, highly structured, or repetitive tasks that require full control, consider using the **Manual Scraper** instead.

## AI Scraper Mode

MrScraper provides three AI Scraper modes:

| Mode | Description | Best Used For |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **General** | Extracts data from a single page using one prompt. | Product detail pages, profile pages, article pages, or any one-off page extraction. |
| **Listing** | Scrapes multiple items from paginated or list-based content (products, categories, posts, listings). | E-commerce category pages, blog indexes, directory listings, search results, and multi-item pages. |
| **Map** | Collects all internal and external links from the target URL. | Site structure mapping, link audits, SEO analysis, and discovering all URLs inside a page. |
## Scraper Types

The AI Scraper offers two types, allowing you to balance between cost efficiency and output quality.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cheap Mode** | More affordable and faster, but with lower accuracy and less complete data. |
| **Super Mode** | More expensive and sometimes fast, sometimes slower, but with higher accuracy, more complete data, uses proxies to avoid bot detection, and is more stealthy. |

<Callout title="Note">
You can switch between modes at any time based on your scraping needs or token budget.
</Callout>

## Screenshot

You can enable screenshot capture to get a visual snapshot of the scraped page along with your data. This is useful for verifying results or archiving page states.

<Callout title="Note">
  Screenshot will always be captured in Super Mode, and is optional in Cheap Mode.
</Callout>

2. Click **New Scraper +** at the top to create a new scraper.
3. Select the Scraper mode and enter the URL to scrape.
4. Choose between **Cheap** or **Super** mode.
5. Wait for the AI to process the provided URL.
6. Enter your prompt describing the data you want to extract.

## Tips and Best Practices

* **Be Specific:** The more precise your prompt, the better your results.
  For example, “Extract product name, price, and availability” works better than “Get product info.”
* **Use Cheap Mode for Simple Tasks:** When testing or scraping structured pages, Cheap Mode saves tokens.
* **Switch to Super Mode for Accuracy:** For messy or dynamic pages, Super Mode ensures better data extraction and faster scraping time.
* **Validate Your Output:** Always review your scraped data to confirm accuracy before automating.
* **Retry When Needed:** If results look incomplete, adjust your prompt and rerun.
