MrScraper’s **AI Scraper** lets you extract structured data from any web page by simply describing what you need — no coding or manual setup required.   You provide a **URL** and a **prompt**, and the AI automatically analyzes the page, extracts relevant data, and returns the result in a structured format like JSON or CSV.

<Callout title="Tip" type="success">
This feature is ideal for users and developers who want fast, flexible, and intelligent web scraping without writing rules or managing selectors.
</Callout>

## When to Use the AI Scraper

Use the AI Scraper when you want to:

- Quickly extract data from a website without building a scraper manually.  
- Collect small to medium-sized datasets with natural language instructions.  
- Automate repetitive data collection tasks where precision is less critical.  
- Prototype or test scraping ideas before committing to a full custom workflow.  

For large-scale, highly structured, or repetitive tasks that require full control, consider using the **Manual Scraper** instead.


## AI Modes

The AI Scraper offers two modes, allowing you to balance between cost efficiency and output quality.

| Mode |  Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Cheap Mode** |  Simple pages with clear structure (e.g., e-commerce listings, article summaries). |
| **Super Mode** |  Complex pages, unstructured content, or when precision matters. |

<Callout title="Note">
You can switch between modes at any time based on your scraping needs or token budget.
</Callout>

### Screenshot

You can enable screenshot capture to get a visual snapshot of the scraped page along with your data. This is useful for verifying results or archiving page states.

<Callout title="Note">
  Screenshot will always be captured in Super Mode, and is optional in Cheap Mode.
</Callout>

## How It Works

AI Scraper is powered by large language models that understand both the **page content** and your **prompt instructions**.

Here’s how it works under the hood:

1. You provide a **URL** and a **prompt** describing what you want to extract.  
2. The AI loads and analyzes the target web page.  
3. It interprets your prompt, locates relevant data, and generates structured output.  



## Usage Example

Follow these steps to use the AI Scraper from your dashboard:

1. Go to your **Dashboard** → click **Create Scraper**.   
2. Enter the **URL** you want to scrape.  
3. Choose between **Cheap** or **Super** mode.
4. Wait for the AI to process the provided URL.
5. Enter your prompt describing the data you want to extract.
6. The AI will analyze your prompt and extract the requested data.
7. Once complete, review your results or export them as JSON or CSV.


### Example Prompts

You can guide the AI using simple, natural language prompts.  
Here are a few examples to get you started:

## Tips and Best Practices

* **Be Specific:** The more precise your prompt, the better your results.
  For example, “Extract product name, price, and availability” works better than “Get product info.”
* **Use Cheap Mode for Simple Tasks:** When testing or scraping structured pages, Cheap Mode saves tokens.
* **Switch to Super Mode for Accuracy:** For messy or dynamic pages, Super Mode ensures better parsing and extraction.
* **Validate Your Output:** Always review your scraped data to confirm accuracy before automating.
* **Retry When Needed:** If results look incomplete, adjust your prompt and rerun.
