import { ShoppingCart } from 'lucide-react';

Listing mode is used when a page contains a repeating set of items (for example an ecommerce product list, job listings, or search results) where each visible item links to a details page or opens a detail panel that must be visited to collect the full data for that item.

## When to use the Listing mode

- Use Listing when items on a page provide only summary data and you need to open each item to retrieve full details (specs, full description, images, variants, etc.).
- Use Listing for paginated result pages, infinite-scroll feeds, or any list-like layout where the full record is available only from the item's detail view.
