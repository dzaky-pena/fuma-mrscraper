Listing mode is best for pages with a repeating list of items, such as product grids, job listings, or search results. The scraper automatically visits each item’s detail page to collect the full information.
## General vs Listing

- **General Mode** extracts only what is visible on the listing page.  
- **Listing Mode** goes deeper by visiting each item’s detail page to obtain full information such as specifications, long descriptions, images, and variants.

<Callout title="Tip" type="success">
Use Listing mode when you need richer, more complete data.
</Callout>
## When to use the Listing mode

- Use Listing when items on a page provide only summary data and you need to open each item to retrieve full details (specs, full description, images, variants, etc.).
- Use Listing for paginated result pages, infinite-scroll feeds, or any list-like layout where the full record is available only from the item's detail view.

## Example Usage

1. Go to your **Dashboard** → click **Create Scraper** → select **Listing**.   
2. Enter the **URL** (for example: `https://books.toscrape.com/`) you want to scrape.
3. MrScraper will extract all items, visit their detail pages, and return a complete dataset.
4. Below is an example showing the difference between **Listing mode** and **General mode** when scraping the same page.
