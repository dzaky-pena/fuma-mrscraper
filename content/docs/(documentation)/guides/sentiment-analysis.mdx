Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and market trends.

## Scenario

You’re a product manager at a laptop company competing with another brand.  
You want to understand what customers think about one of the competitor’s brand gaming laptops available on **Walmart**.  
By analyzing reviews, you can identify what users appreciate (e.g., performance, design) and what frustrates them (e.g., setup issues, reliability).

## Step 1: Create a New AI Scraper

1. Go to the **Scrapers** page by clicking the **triangle icon** on the left sidebar.
2. Click on the **Create Scraper** button.
3. Select the **General Scraper** option.
4. In the **Target URL** field, enter the URL of the product's review page you want to scrape. For example: `https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/15843466879?entryPoint=viewAllReviewsTop`.
5. Click on the **Start Scraping** button to start scraping.

      "text": "Our son ordered this and he is very happy with how it helps him play video games. Can't say I love that he does that, but he said it really does improve the quality and availability of games for him, and he's pretty good about limiting his own time on devices.",

      "text": "It was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Loves it so much I bought a second one for my other daughter so they could play their games together. Great computer for gamers.",

      "date": "Sep 5, 2025",
      "text": "To start, it's an awesome laptop. It fit my budget and can play games and do school work when I need it to. One pay made it very easy to get it without having to spend too much at once (I'm a broke college student). My order also arrived faster than the estimated time which was already pretty quick. Not only that but I got it at a cheap price on clearance.",

    {
      "date": "Sep 4, 2025",
      "text": "It never fails, really. I always seem to be on the receiving end of crappy products. I JUST got this thing TODAY and I can't even get it to setup! Persistent error messages 'Something went wrong' yadayada. This review is staying all the way bad until I get my money back or some reliable customer support cause this is not okay.",

## Step 2: Analyze Sentiment with AI

You can now analyze the sentiment of the extracted user reviews using your preferred AI tool or library. For example, you can use Python's `TextBlob` or `VADER` to classify the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral.

| Sentiment | Example Review                                                             | Insight                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive  | “Great computer for gamers.”                                               | Strong satisfaction with performance                       |
| Positive  | “Awesome laptop... plays games and does school work.”                      | Product fits well for multitasking                         |
| Negative  | “I JUST got this thing TODAY and I can’t even get it to setup!”            | Setup/reliability issues                                   |
| Neutral   | “Our son ordered this... he’s happy but I don’t love that he plays games.” | Mixed sentiment; happy performance but concern over gaming |
