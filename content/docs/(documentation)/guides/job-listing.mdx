Extracting job listings manually from job boards can be tedious and time-consuming. With **MrScraper’s AI Scraper**, you can automate this process entirely — providing only a URL and a short prompt describing what to extract.  

In this guide, we’ll walk through a **real-world example** where a recruitment team uses MrScraper to gather and analyze data from a live job board to inform their hiring strategy.


## Scenario

Imagine you’re an HR specialist at a growing tech startup planning to hire a **Data Scientist**.  
Before posting your own job, you want to understand:

- What skills and qualifications are most in-demand  
- How other companies describe their Data Scientist roles  
- Which cities or companies are hiring for similar positions  

## Step 1: Create a New AI Scraper

1. Go to your **MrScraper Dashboard** → click **Create Scraper**.  
2. Enter the URL: `https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/indonesia-data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,9_IN113_KO10,25.htm`
3. Choose **AI Scraper** as your scraper type.  
4. Select **Super Mode** to get more accurate and structured extraction for job listings.


## Step 2: Filter Out

Next, tell the AI exactly what kind of job data you want to capture. The prompt defines both the structure of your results and any filters to apply. For this use case, you can use the following prompt:
```md
Extract only job listings with the job title "Data Scientist" that are suitable for fresh graduates or candidates with a minimum of 2 years of experience, and include required skills details.

For each listing, return these fields:
- Job Title
- Company Name
- Location
- Salary
- Job Type
- Experience Level
- Posted Date
- Job Description
- Required Skills
- Job URL

Filter out any listing that does not include required skills information or requires more than 2 years of experience.
```
Here’s a sample output:

## Step 3: Use the Extracted Data
Once you’ve collected the job listings, you can export and use the data directly from the dashboard in your preferred format.
