Running scrapers efficiently helps you get the most value out of MrScraper without unnecessary usage costs.  
This guide explains how to **optimize scraping costs** through smart configuration, scraper mode selection, scheduling, and output management.


## 1. Choose the Right Scraper Mode

MrScraper offers two AI Scraper modes that affect both cost and performance:

| Mode | Description | When to Use | Cost Impact |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Cheap Mode** | Fast and lightweight extraction. Suitable for simple, structured pages. | Use for lists or data with consistent structure (e.g., product names, prices). | 💲 Lowest |
| **Super Mode** | More accurate and intelligent extraction. Ideal for complex layouts or nested content. | Use for unstructured data or multiple data types (e.g., job listings, reviews). | 💲💲 Higher |

<Callout title="Tip" type="success">
Start with **Cheap Mode** — if your data is inconsistent or incomplete, switch to **Super Mode** only for that page.
</Callout>


## 2. Limit Extraction Scope

The broader your prompt, the more resources are used.  
Narrowing your extraction target saves cost and improves precision.

| ❌ *Expensive prompt*   | ✅ *Optimized prompt* | 
|------|--------------|
| Extract all details from this e-commerce page. | Extract product name, price, and rating from this page. |

<Callout title="Best Practice">
Focus on the **fields you actually need**. If you only need names and prices, don’t extract full descriptions or metadata.
</Callout>


## 3. Use Pagination and Sampling

Instead of scraping all pages at once, you can:

- Scrape **only the first few pages** to test data quality.  
- Schedule scraping in **batches** (e.g., 100 pages/day).  
- Sample data periodically for large websites (weekly or monthly updates).

This reduces both request volume and processing time — lowering overall usage costs.


## 4. Reuse and Recycle Results

Each time you run a scraper, you pay for the extraction process.  
Avoid re-running scrapers unnecessarily by reusing existing results.

**Example Workflow:**

- Store your output in a **Database Connection** or export as **CSV/JSON**.
- Only re-run the scraper when the target site changes.
- Use **Scheduling** for incremental updates instead of full refreshes.


## 5. Use Scheduling Strategically

Scraping too frequently can increase costs without adding value.  
Instead, match your schedule to how often the target data changes.

<Callout title="Tip">
Avoid overlapping schedules. Running multiple scrapers at the same time can spike costs and reduce performance.

## 6. Optimize Proxy Usage

While proxies add flexibility, they can slightly increase scraping overhead.

- Use **MrScraper’s built-in proxy** instead of external providers to save cost and setup time.
- Only enable proxies for websites that require regional access or IP rotation.
- For internal or low-risk pages, disable proxy entirely.


## 7. Monitor Usage

Keep an eye on your scraper usage and performance using the **Analytics** feature.  
Regularly review:

- The number of pages or URLs processed  
- Success rate and data completeness  
- AI vs. manual mode distribution  

This helps you spot overuse early and plan your scraping strategy efficiently.


<Callout title="Pro Tip" type="success">
Start small. Run initial tests on limited pages using **Cheap Mode**, verify output accuracy, and scale up gradually.
