Real estate professionals, investors, and analysts can use MrScraper to collect property listings from public real estate websites. Instead of checking hundreds of listings manually, the AI Scraper extracts property details for you using only a URL and a short prompt.

Let's walk through a **real-world example** where you can uses MrScraper to collect data from a live property listing site.


## Scenario

You want to explore the Michigan housing market and compare prices, home sizes, and features across different cities. Rather than visiting multiple listing sites every day, you can use MrScraper to pull structured data directly from Redfin, making it easier to review options and find the best value.

## Step 1: Create a New AI Scraper

2. Click on the **Create Scraper** button.
3. Select the **Listing Scraper** option.
4. In the **URL** field, enter the URL of the Michigan property listings page: `https://www.redfin.com/state/Michigan`.
5. Click on the **Start Scraping** button to start scraping.

**Result :**

    "..."
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Filter Out

Tell the AI to filter the scraped results based on specific criteria. For this example, let's filter for smaller, more affordable properties under 2,000 square feet using the following prompt:
```md
Get only properties with less than 2000 square feet
```


Here’s a sample output:

```json title="Filtered Scraping Result"
{
  "mode": "direct",
  "count": 28,
  "properties": [
    {
      "beds": "2 beds",
      "link": "/MI/Northville/15943-Morningside-48168/home/98892034",
      "sqft": 1653,
      "baths": "2 baths",
      "price": "$273,000",
      "address": "15943 Morningside, Northville, MI 48168"
    },
    {
      "beds": "3 beds",
      "link": "/MI/Northville/9824-Hathaway-Dr-48167/home/99341712",
      "sqft": 1000,
      "baths": "2 baths",
      "price": "$55,000",
      "address": "9824 Hathaway Dr, Northville, MI 48167"
    },
    {
      "beds": "2 beds",
      "link": "/MI/Northville/42432-Corlina-Dr-48167/home/98883824",
      "sqft": 1800,
      "baths": "2.5 baths",
      "price": "$350,000",
      "address": "42432 Corlina Dr, Northville, MI 48167"
    },
    {
      "beds": "2 beds",
      "link": "/MI/Novi/39928-Crosswinds-48375/home/61133922",
      "sqft": 1100,
      "baths": "1.5 baths",
      "price": "$210,000",
      "address": "39928 Crosswinds, Novi, MI 48375 5004"
    },
    {
      "beds": "3 beds",
      "link": "/MI/Novi/22415-Cranbrooke-Dr-48375/home/199166800",
      "sqft": 1304,
      "baths": "1.5 baths",
      "price": "$249,999",
      "address": "22415 Cranbrooke Dr, Novi, MI 48375 4502"
    },
    {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Use the Data
The results include smaller homes and condos across cities like Detroit, Ann Arbor, Livonia, Troy, Farmington, Novi, and Northville — making it easy to compare options side by side.
