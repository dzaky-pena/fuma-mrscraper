<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="How do I get my API Token?">
You can find it under **Dashboard → API Token**. Keep it private — it authenticates your scraper requests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use MrScraper without coding?">
Yes. Use **AI Mode** to describe what you want to extract in plain text (for example: “extract product name, price, and rating”).  
No coding or CSS selectors are required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my scrape not returning any data?">
Check if the target page loads data dynamically (via JavaScript).  
Try using **Super AI Mode** or using a **proxy** from the correct region to capture all content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What’s the difference between AI Mode and Manual Mode?">
- **AI Mode**: Automatically detects and extracts data from the page based on your prompt — fastest for general use.  
- **Manual Mode**: Lets you define your own selectors or extraction logic — best for consistent, repeatable scrapes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use a proxy?">
Use a proxy if:  
- The website blocks or rate-limits your IP  
- You need to access geo-restricted or localized content (like job boards or e-commerce sites)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does MrScraper provide built-in proxies?">
Yes. MrScraper offers **built-in proxies** for many regions (such as the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, and India). You can also **enter your own proxy URL** if you prefer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I schedule scrapers to run automatically?">
Yes. Use the **Schedule** feature to run scrapers hourly, daily, or weekly — perfect for tracking price changes or job listings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use MrScraper to track product reviews or sentiment?">
Yes. For example, you can scrape customer reviews from  [Walmart product reviews](https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/15843466879?entryPoint=viewAllReviewsTop) and analyze the text for positive or negative sentiment trends.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I extract job listings with specific criteria?">
Use a prompt like:  
> “Extract job title, company name, location, salary, and job description for Data Scientist roles requiring 2 years of experience.”  
See the [Job Listing Guide](https://fuma-mrscraper.vercel.app/docs/guides/job-listing) for a complete walkthrough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I lower my scraping costs?">
- Use **Manual Mode** when the page structure is stable.  
- Avoid re-scraping unchanged pages.  
- Schedule scrapers efficiently (e.g., weekly instead of hourly).  
- Disable proxies if geo-targeting isn’t needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can MrScraper send my data automatically?">
Yes, MrScraper integrates with:  
- **Email** (to send results to your inbox)  
- **SQL Databases** (to store structured data)  
- **Webhooks** (to send data to your APIs or automation workflows)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting blocked or rate-limited?">
Some sites detect repeated requests. Enable a **proxy**, reduce your scrape frequency, or alternate between multiple proxy locations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My scheduled scrapes didn’t run — what can I check?">
Ensure that:  
- The **schedule** is enabled  
- The **timezone** is correct  
- The scraper is **active** and not in draft mode
</Accordion>
