When you run a scraper, the results are typically returned in a structured format such as JSON. The exact structure of the results will depend on the specific scraper you are using and the data it is designed to collect.

## Accessing Scraper Results

To access the results from a scraper, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open result page

Navigate to **Result page** by clicking the **playlist icon** on the left sidebar.

### Step 2: Click on a scraper to view the results

### Step 3: View the results

In this page, there are four tabs you can choose from, **Extractions**, **Screenshots**, **Recording**, and **HTML**.

- **Extractions**: This tab displays the structured data extracted by the scraper in JSON format.
- **Screenshots**: This tab shows the screenshots of the pages that were scraped.
- **Recording**: This tab contains the video recording of the entire scraping session.

    <Callout title="Note">
        The **Recording** tab will only be available if you use manual scraper mode.

- **HTML**: This tab provides the raw HTML content of the pages that were scraped.
