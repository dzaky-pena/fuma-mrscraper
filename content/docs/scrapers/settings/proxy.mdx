## What Is Proxy?

A proxy acts as an intermediary between your scraper and the target website. It helps to mask your IP address, allowing you to avoid IP bans and access geo-restricted content.

## How to Configure Proxy Settings


### Step 1: Open Your Scraper Settings

1. Navigate to your **Scrapers page** by clicking the **triangle icon** on the left sidebar.

2. Select the scraper you want to configure.
3. Click on the **Settings** button, and click **Proxy Settings**.

### Step 2: Configure Proxy

1. In the **Proxy Settings** menu, toggle the **Enable Proxy**.

2. Enter your proxy URL.

    <Callout title="Note">
        Format: http://username:password@host:port or https://host:port
    </Callout>

3. Click **Save Settings** to use your proxy.
