## Overview

The MrScraper API uses API key authentication to secure all endpoints. Every API request must include a valid API key in the request headers.

## Getting Your API Key

You can get your API Key by following these [steps](/docs/getting-started/api-token#generating-an-api-token).

## Make Your First Call

Authentication is handled using HTTP Basic Auth. Include your API Key in the request header when accessing any MrScraper API endpoint.

```http
x-api-token: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

For example, to [retrieve scraping results](/docs/api/Results), you would make the following cURL request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.v3.app.mrscraper.com/api/v1/results?filters[scraperId]=<SCRAPER_ID>&page=1&pageSize=10&sort=createdAt&sortOrder=DESC" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-token: YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```
