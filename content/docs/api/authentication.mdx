## Overview

The MrScraper API uses API key authentication to secure all endpoints. Every API request must include a valid API key in the request headers.

## Authentication Method

### API Key Header

All authenticated requests must include the `x-api-token` header with your API key:

```http
x-api-token: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your MrScraper dashboard
2. Navigate to **Profile** → **API Tokens**
3. Click **New Token**
4. Copy and securely store your API key
